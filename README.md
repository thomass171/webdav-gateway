# webdav-gateway
A simple read only gateway/bridge for mapping a webdav interface (eg. Nextcloud) to an easy to use REST like HTTP endpoint. This might than be used for web clients for easy fetching webdav data. 

Providing a CORS proxy was the initial and main reason for this gateway.

https://github.com/thomass171/web-photo-album is a web photo album that uses this gateway.
